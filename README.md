# Medical-Chatbot-with-LLMs-LangChain-Pinecone-Flask-AWS
This project is an advanced AI-powered medical chatbot designed to assist users with healthcare-related queries using Large Language Models (LLMs). It integrates multiple cutting-edge technologies to deliver accurate, context-aware, and real-time medical support through natural conversations.

## Key Features:
Conversational AI with LLMs:
Utilizes state-of-the-art large language models (such as OpenAI's GPT) to understand and respond to complex medical questions with human-like fluency.

Slang Integration:
Leverages Slang.ai for voice and conversational capabilities, enabling more natural and interactive user experiences.

Semantic Search with Pinecone:
Employs Pinecone to perform vector-based similarity search over a curated database of medical knowledge (FAQs, symptoms, diseases, treatments). This ensures that responses are not just generative but grounded in real, relevant data.

Backend with Flask:
A lightweight and scalable Flask backend handles API endpoints, request routing, and integrates the various components including LLM, Pinecone, and AWS services.

Cloud Deployment with AWS:
The chatbot is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for high availability, security, and scalability. AWS services like EC2, S3, and Lambda are used for hosting, storage, and compute efficiency.

### Use Cases:
General medical advice and health education

Preliminary symptom checking

Mental health and wellness support

Follow-up reminders or medication tracking

### Tech Stack:
LLM: OpenAI GPT / HuggingFace Transformers

Slang.ai: Voice and chat interface

Pinecone: Vector database for semantic search

Flask: Python web framework for the backend

AWS: Deployment and cloud infrastructure
